[Personal advice for Daily Use]

Cayo->Casino->Dooms day->Dre After the end, wait 1-2 hours and repeat the process. ~ 2.5M+3.5M+2.5M+2.5M = 11M

Classic heist = Once Per day ~ Fleeca 6M/15M or Pacific Standard 6M/15M + Mastermind Award 12M (24 hour interval)

Doom's day Senario Mastermind = Once per day ~ 4P 2.5M+4.6M or 3P 2.5M+2.4M or 2P 2.5M+1.3M (12 hour interval)

MC Business = Recommended to ship Twice per day ~ 7.5M * 2 = 15M (24 hour interval)
